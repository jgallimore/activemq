# Enable sdkman 'sdk env' feature to auto environment setup

# Installation (only one time):
# After checking out a new project, you may be missing some SDKs
# specified in the project's .sdkmanrc file. To install these
# missing SDKs, just type:
# sdk env install

# Usage:
# To switch to the configuration present in your .sdkmanrc file,
# simply issue the following command:
# sdk env

# Optional:
# Do you want to switch SDK versions automatically when you cd into
# a directory? This can be done by setting the sdkman_auto_env=true
# in you SDKMAN configuration. Note that this will also reset any
# project-specific SDKs to their default version when leaving the
# directory.
